=========

Our project is a robot that can autonomously solve a maze. The robot explores a maze, extracts informaiton about the walls of the maze from sensors and uses the data to determine its orientation. It uses the same sensor data to navigate through the maze and avoid obstacles. As the robot learns about the walls in the maze, it applies a maze solving algorithm to find the shortest path to the center of the maze, and traverses that path as quickly as possible. Our robot was entered into the IEEE Region 1 Micromouse Competition in the Spring of 2014.
